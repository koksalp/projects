# Logic Simulator 
A logic simulator project that allows users to do many things they can do when using a professional logic simulator such as getting logic gates from tool pane and placing them anywhere in the workbench, connecting logic elements with wires, deleting elements etc. The project has been implemented in C++ and SFML library has been used for visualization. This is the final project of object oriented programming class that I took in university. Unfortunately, the project has not been finished because this was a group project (3 people) but my teammates gave up due to its complexity so there is a part left undone where users can actually simulate the current state after placing and connecting logic elements. There is also a project report that explains how the program works in detail. I have got 95/100 from this project and passed the class with the letter grade of BA (3.5/4.0 - second highest after AA).
